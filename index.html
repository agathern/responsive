      The Orchids

 	The white petals that fade into lavender frame the yellow interior of the orchid. There are four stems leaning side to side with flowers along the line. Some are made to be closed, surrounded by the ones that have bloomed. The dark green stem is held up by another brand, tied together for support. The forrest green leaves sprout from the bottom of the stems, covering most of the dirt and roots.The roots stick out of the wide and clear pot, which is filled with brown dirt that always looks moist. However, the composition deceives the eyes, making us believe the flowers are real.
